              Assembler version of FORFMID processing


PLEASE READ ALL OF THESE NOTES......

 >>>>>  Recent Changes in this File:

 >>>>>
      All of the functionality of all of the programs in this file,
      can now be found in the 2 programs:  PUTXREF and SMPUPD.

      The other programs are included only for historical reasons,
      and as backup, in case some defect might appear in the current
      version of the main two programs.

      I have "assemblerized" the processing in this file.  You don't
need COBOL any more.  I have kept the old COBOL programs here for now,
just in case there is some lack in the Assembler Language versions.

      Renames of programs are as follows:
       (First name is the current program name, second name is the name
        of the replaced program, in this current version of the file.)

  PUTXREF  is instead of PUTXREFV (the old version)
     reason:  We needed FBA blocked output instead of VBA unblocked.
     reason:  A new optional //SMPCOUT dd card gets you the same
              output from PUTXREF, as SMPASUPD produces from the
              //PRINTER output of PUTXREF.

  SMPASUPD is instead of SMPFBUPD (the old FB version)
     reason:  Same function.  Coded in Assembler instead of COBOL.

  SMPUPD   is instead of SMPUPDCB (the old version)
     reason:  Same function.  Coded in Assembler instead of COBOL.
              Added much SYSPRINT reporting for the output of the
              Assembler SMPUPD program, and a READ-only option.

      I have finally made the FORFMID processing independent of COBOL.
The new version of the PUTXREF program, now puts out its report output
to the PRINTER DD as an FBA blocked file, instead of as a VBA unblocked
file.  Therefore the DCB attributes of the PRINTER file can be like:

//PRINTER  DD  DSN=&TEMP1,DISP=(NEW,PASS),UNIT=SYSDA,
//         DCB=(RECFM=FBA,LRECL=133,BLKSIZE=27930),
//         SPACE=(TRK,(60,45))
//SMPCOUT  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=WSBG.PTFPDS(TESTSEQO)    <== OPTIONAL DDNAME
//*                                      <== FB-80 ./ ADD NAME= output

The older version of the PUTXREF program that produces VBA PRINTER
output, is now called PUTXREFV.

The full JCL stream to do this processing is now called JCLFMIDS.
The full JCL stream to do this processing using //SMPCOUT output
    of the PUTXREF program, is called JCL3.

The assembler version of the post-processor program is called SMPASUPD.
This program takes only the fixed blocked input from the new version
of PUTXREF.  Or as an alternative, don't run SMPASUPD, but code a
//SMPCOUT DD card as output from the PUTXREF program directly.

The COBOL post-processor programs SMPFMUPV and SMPFMUPD are still being
kept here, in case there might be a problem with the assembler version.
The JCL stream using the old PUTXREF program, has the program name now
changed to PUTXREFV.

Gene Cray's modification to only look for one FMID, has been included
in (LEVEL 006 of) the PUTXREF program.  JCL additions to run his code,
which are totally optional, are:

//SRCHDATA DD  *
HBB6603
//*  TO USE, PLACE FMID NUMBER IN COLS 1-7 ABOVE, AFTER THE SRCHDATA
//*  CARD.
//*  IF YOU WANT A LISTING OF THE WHOLE TAPE, TYPE IN 'ALL', INSTEAD.
/*

The use of the SRCHDATA ddname is entirely optional, and I'd only
recommend using it in the JCL, if its function is needed.
