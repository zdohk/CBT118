         Original Function (Before extra DD names were added)

         This program takes the PUT PTF file (File 1 from a
         standard IBM PUT tape), and produces a cross
         reference of the PTF's included, sorted by FMID.
         It can take concatenated input, but the tape identity
         on which the PTF is found will be lost.  The program
         should be useful to quickly identify what PTF's
         are on a given tape, what FMID's have maintenance on
         a tape, and to double check the cross reference (it
         lies once in a while.)

         DEPENDENCIES:

         1.    This program has an invoked incore sort.
               It links to the entry point of "SORT".
               change the link macro if you do not support
               that name or alias.  You will need about
               300K for the whole program and SORT.

         2.    TITLES.  This file (for FMID titles) is
               optional.  If not included, you will get a
               warning message on your SYSOUT, and no titles.

               I have included the file in the JCL, I
               created the file by doing the following:

               A. ALLOCATE A DATA SET ON TSO  - NORMAL STUFF -
                   RECFM=FB,LRECL=80
               B.  ASSIGN THAT DATA SET TO DD NAME OF OZPRINT
               C.  EXECUTE YOUR INFO - SYS CLIST OR COMMAND
               D.  ISSUE A 'DEF A' COMMAND TO INFO (SEARCH
                   ALL FILES)
               E.  DO A KEY WORD SEARCH AS FOLLOWS -
                   KWS FMID XREF      I GOT ABOUT 22 HITS,
                   BUT THE FIRST ONE HAD A TITLE OF
                   'THIS IS A CROSS REFERENCE OF MVS FMIDS',
                   OR SOMETHING SIMILAR. BE SURE YOU
                   HAVE THE LATEST ONE
               F.  SELECT THE CORRECT ONE, THE ISSUE A
                   'PRINT UP' COMMAND. THE OUTPUT WILL GO
                   TO THE DATA SET ALLOCATED TO THE OZPRINT
                   DDNAME
               G.  END YOUR INFO SESSION
               H.  EDIT YOUR PRINT FROM THE INFO SESSION
                   YOU WANT TO DELETE ALL LINES THAT DO
                   NOT HAVE AN FMID IN COLUMN 3. NOTE THAT DELETED
                   FMIDS HAVE A * IN COLUMN 3, FOR BETTER
                   DOCUMENTATION I DELETE THE STAR ANDMOVE THE
                   FMID BACK TO 3, BUT THIS IS
                   OPTIONAL.
               I.  AFTER YOU HAVE SAVED THE DATA SET,
                   SORT IT ON COLUMN 3 FOR A LENGTH OF 7.
               J.  THE TITLE LIST YOU HAVE JUST CREATED
                   CAN BE EITHER INCLUDED IN THE JCL STREAM
                   OR KEPT IN A SEPERATE DATA SET, AND POINTED
                   TO BY THE JCL.
         3.    REGS MACRO. THE STANDARD REGISTER EQUATES
               SUCH AS IN R1      EQU    1      ETC.
               NOTE - REMOVED ON 3/10/82

         CHANGES FOR RELEASE 3.0
         1.    CHANGED INPUT LOCATION OF TITLES FROM COLUMN 2 TO
               COLUMN 3. THIS ALLOWS USE OF THE OUTPUT OF THE
               OZPRINT DD STATEMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO DELETE
               THE CARRIAGE CONTROL INFO COMPLETELY. SEE THE INFO IN
               2. ABOVE FOR DETAILS ON HOW TO CREATE THE TITLE
               FILE.
         2.    EXTENDED SIZE OF THE TITLE FIELD TO INCLUDE
               THE COMPONENT ID NOW THAT IBM HAS
               INCLUDED IT IN THE FMID XREF.

         CHANGES FOR RELEASE 2.0:
         1. ADDED BLOCKSIZES TO DCB MACROS TO CORRECT DEPENDENCY
            ON LOCAL MODS
         2. CORRECTED SORT FIELDS STATEMENT IN PROGRAM. ONLY USED IF
            IBM SORT IS INVOKED. NOTE THAT PARM ERROR SEEMS TO BE
            A STANDARD FEATURE WITH THIS PROGRAM - I CAN FIND NO ERROR
         3. SYSOUT JCL DD STATEMENT ADDED FOR IBM SORTS

         MACROS.
