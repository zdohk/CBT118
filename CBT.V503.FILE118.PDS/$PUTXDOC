*  MODIFIED APRIL 26, '88 BY SHMUEL GOLOB             TO ONLY       SBG
*    LOOK FOR FMID KEYWORD IF YOU'RE LEGITIMATELY WITHIN A ++VER    SBG
*    STATEMENT.  LEFT ALL THE OTHER STUFF IN AS SAFETY CHECKS.      SBG
*    PLEASE INFORM ME             (212) 206-5847 IF THIS VERSION    SBG
*    OF THE PROGRAM FAILS TO WORK.  (CODE CAN USE CLEANING UP.)     SBG
*                                                                   SBG
*  MODIFIED APRIL 25, '88 BY SHMUEL GOLOB             TO FIX A FEW  SBG
*    BUGS.  THE PROGRAM CAN NOW DETECT IF THE FMID KEYWORD IS IN    SBG
*    A COMMENT AREA.  IT ALSO KNOWS THAT IN THE INSIDE OF JCLIN YOU SBG
*    CAN'T TEST FOR A COMMENT AREA, AND IT WON'T TEST FOR AN FMID   SBG
*    KEYWORD THERE EITHER.  ALSO FIXED BUG THAT 1ST CHARACTER       SBG
*    OF THE FMID WAS CHOPPED OFF IF THERE WERE AN ODD NUMBER OF     SBG
*    SPACES BETWEEN THE OPEN PAREN AFTER THE FMID KEYWORD, AND      SBG
*    THE FIRST NON-BLANK.  ANOTHER BUG WAS THAT THE FMID KEYWORD    SBG
*    IN A ++IF STATEMENT WAS IGNORED ONLY ON THE SAME LINE AS THE   SBG
*    ++IF, BUT NOT ON THE FOLLOWING LINES UNDER THE ++IF'S CONTROL. SBG
*                                                                    *
*  MODIFIED JUNE 26, 1986 BY SHMUEL GOLOB             TO LOOK AT     *
*    ++APAR, ++USERMOD, AND ++FUNCTION IN ADDITION TO ++PTF.         *
*    ( I WANT TO KNOW WHAT FMIDS MY APARS AND USERMODS BELONG TO! )  *
*                                                                    *
*  THIS CODE WAS OBTAINED FROM FILE 118 OF THE CBT MVS MODS TAPE,    *
*    VERSION 260.  THE CODE THERE ONLY EXTRACTS PTFS.  I HAVE        *
*    MODIFIED IT IN THIS VERSION TO RECOGNIZE APARS, USERMODS, AND   *
*    FUNCTION SYSMODS ALSO.                                          *
*                                                                    *
*  THE OLD VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM REMAINS ON THIS FILE UNDER THE    *
*    MEMBER NAME PTFSXREF.  THE MEMBER OFILE118 HAS THE EXACT        *
*    CONTENTS OF FILE 118 FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE CBT TAPE.    *
*                                                                    *
*  MY PROGRAM, SMPFMUPV, FROM FILE 428 OF THE CBT TAPE               *
*    CONVERTS THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM TO THE FORMAT:              *
*    ./  ADD  NAME=FMIDNAM                                           *
*          UZ11111  /*  FMID - FMIDNAM - FROM PUT TAPE - DATE  */    *
*                                                                    *
*    THIS IS SUITABLE FOR INPUT TO AN SMP APPLY OR LIST              *
*    JOB.  WE GET A "FORFMID" EFFECT, GOOD ON ANY VERSION            *
*    OF SMP, BECAUSE IT'S ONLY DEPENDENT ON THE SMPPTFIN FILE,       *
*    AND NOT ON THE VERSION OF SMP WHICH WILL PROCESS THAT FILE.     *
*                                                                    *
*    PLEASE LOOK ON FILE 428 TO GET THE MOST MILEAGE FROM THIS       *
*    PROGRAM, AND FOR OTHER USEFUL SMP TOOLS.                        *
