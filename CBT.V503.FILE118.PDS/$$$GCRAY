All the functionality from Gene Cray's modification to PUTXREF, which
he named SMPEXREF, has been included in (LEVEL 006 of) the PUTXREF
program.  Gene Cray's program was originally on File 033 of the CBT
Tape, and it is now being eliminated from being a separate file on
the CBT Tape.

If you are currently using Gene's version of the PUTXREF program, you
can keep using the same JCL to run this program instead, except for the
change in program name.  Sample JCL has been included here, as member
PUTXREF#.
