         Some more notes on SMP/E input processing
         ---- ---- ----- -- ----- ----- ----------


1.  PTFs as shipped from IBM ain't quite what they used to be.
    However, we can handle the differences, at least partially.

    For example, we can handle compaction.  This process seems
    to have been meant to reduce the bulk in PTFs that are being
    shipped electronically.  However, in my biased opinion, the
    process does not seem to save that much space.  It does serve
    to obfuscate the content of the PTFs (namely the object decks)
    and therefore the actual content of the PTF becomes harder to
    understand.

    Nevertheless, a simple process, using the IBM utility GIMCPTS
    with the following sample JCL, can "expand" the PTF's material
    and show you most of the original content.  The only parts of
    the PTF which remain obfuscated, are the modules presented in
    $$.GIMDTS  FORMAT .

    Simple expansion of each PTF can be done using the following
    prototype JCL:


    //SBGOLOBG  JOB (ACCT#),S-GOLOB,
    // NOTIFY=&SYSUID,
    // CLASS=B,MSGCLASS=X
    //*
    //EXPPTF  PROC MEM=XXX
    //UNZIP   EXEC PGM=GIMCPTS,PARM='EXPAND,LANGUAGE=ENU'
    //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSUT1   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.PTFSyymm.PTFS(&MEM)  *input
    //SYSUT2   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.PTFSyymm.PTEX(&MEM)  *output
    //        PEND
    //*
    //PTFNUMB EXEC EXPPTF,MEM=PTFNUMB

       etc.

    where the SYSUT2 DD name points to the output dataset.

    All SMPPTS control statements and comment statements are
    unchanged by this process.  Only the contents of the
    modules are expanded.

    Again I must emphasize that the contents of
    $$.GIMDTS  FORMAT material still remains unchanged after
    this process.

    Sequential SMPPTFIN datasets are also handled correctly
    by the GIMCPTS program, and you can use the following
    sample JCL as an example:

    //SBGOLOBG  JOB (ACCT#),S-GOLOB,
    // NOTIFY=&SYSUID,
    // CLASS=B,MSGCLASS=X
    //*
    //UNZIP   EXEC PGM=GIMCPTS,PARM='EXPAND,LANGUAGE=ENU'
    //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSUT1   DD  DISP=OLD,DSN=SBGOLOB.SMPPTFIN.SEQPTFS  *input
    //SYSUT2   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.SMPPTFIN.SEQPTEX  *output
    //SYSIN    DD  DUMMY


2.  Since comments and SMP control cards inside the PTFs are not
    changed by GIMCPTS processing at all, our own programs,
    PUTXREF and SMPUPD are not affected in their operation at all,
    except for their report of the number of cards read in each
    PTF.
