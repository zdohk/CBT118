              Keeping the TITLES File Up to Date


      You may wonder how to keep the TITLES file up to date, to put
FMID names on the PUTXREF reports.  My advice is to get an FMID list
from the ESO Tape, if you have that service.  This FMID list is
customized to the products you have, and you just need to edit the
list a bit, to put it into the format required by the TITLES file.

      This is an example of the relevant parts of the FMID list from
File 3 of the first ESO tape:

  PRODUCT     SERVICE              PRODUCT            PRODUCT
   FMIDS       (Y/N)             DESCRIPTION          V, R, M
  -------     -------    ---------------------------- -------

  EBT1102        N       MVS 3.8 BTAM                 01.01.00
  EBT1102        N       MVS 3.8 BTAM                 01.01.00
  EBT1102        N       MVS 3.8 BTAM                 01.01.00
  EDE1102        N       MVS 3.8 DEMF                 01.01.02
  EDE1102        N       MVS 3.8 DEMF                 01.01.02
  EDE1102        N       MVS 3.8 DEMF                 01.01.02
  EDM1102        N       MVS 3.8                      01.01.02

           and so forth .......

      The format that the TITLES file requires is:

  FMID       -   column  3 for  7 characters
  TITLE text -   column 12 for 40 characters  (used to be 34 chars)

      If you are reading this, this file contains PUTXREF LV 005 source
that uses 40 characters for TITLE text information.  The older versions
of PUTXREF used only 34 characters.


      You shouldn't have any problems editing the text from the ESO
tape, File (3,NL), first tape.


      Best of everything.
